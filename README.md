Title: Translatify

Description: Translatify is a translator app that translates words, phrases, and even sentences by the use of your phone's default camera. This app uses Google Cloud Vision API, an API that helps developers to understand the content of an image including object detection, ocr, explicit content, face, logo, and landmark detection.

Scope and Limitation: The goal of this app is to provide translation at no cost. Users can freely use this app to translate the source language to the target language and vice versa. However, the only limitation is the internet connection, because this application will require a connection to send gathered data through the API hosted online and then the exchanged data is sent back to the application.
